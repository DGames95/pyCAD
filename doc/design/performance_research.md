# Performance optimization


I want to compare pure python, numpy and then writing my own c optimization for vector and matrix math

Then also need to figure out the best structure for when to call the c module and how much hsould be done directly in there. I have no idea how calling the module affects speed.


Compare cython, numpy and pybind11, maybe python c api. 

Compare GPU acceleration for matrices: not worth it for small
